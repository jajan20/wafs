## Week 1
### Pro's and Con's

### Frameworks
##### The Pro's
Depending on what your endgoal is but:
- You don't need to be a coding genius to make flashy visualisations.
- It can save a lot of time. 
- It is open-source, which stimulate growth.
- Has a good community.

Even though you don't need to be a coding genius, you will need to have a good understanding of vanilla javascript in order to be able to use jQuery the right way. Sadly it happens a lot that 

#### The Con's
While I myself don't have any direct experience with jQuery, I've searched the internet for some answers and everyone tells me the same thing.

- While jQuery is meant to help you save time and a loads of stuff for you. It'll also make your code really messy or "code spaghetti"
- Most of the time you only need a bit of the jQuery magic, but you'll include the whole library. 

Everything you do with jQuery is also possible with vanilla javascript. In order to obtain a greater understanding of the javascript language it is better to write everything in vanilla. Once you've mastered it completely you can use frameworks to help you.

Acording to "source" in 2017 the library distribution for jQuery was still 83%. Which tells us, that even though everyone says it's dead. It's still actively used around the globe.

### Single Page App VS Multiple Page App

I'll be honest, I didn't really know what the difference was, or what the terms even meant. But I did some diggin and i'm sure that I can explain what is what.

##### Single Page App - Advantages
- Just bits of the page are reloaded when a user makes a request. 
- Everything happens on one page, and this gives a more seamless experience.
- Single Page Apps can cache local storage effectively.

##### Single Page App - Disadvantages
- If the app isn't structured properly, the app can keep building memory.
- Search Engine Optimalisation isn't perfect
- It requires JavaScript.

##### Multiple Page App - Advantages
- Perfect for bigger projects, breadcrumbs on where you are.
- It's a load easier to make search engine optimalisations.


##### Multiple Page App - Disadvantages
- Development can become quite complex, which in turn takes a lot more time.

## Week 2
#### Microblibs
- [Transparancy.JS](https://github.com/leonidas/transparency)
- [Routie.js](http://projects.jga.me/routie/)


#### Assignments
The challenge this week was to use microlibs for routing and templating. Even though it somewhat works, I'm still trying to figure out how it exactly works.
